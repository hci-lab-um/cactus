# Cactus - an accessible browser

Cactus is an accessibility-first browser, designed and optimised to work with alternative input modalities such as eye-trackers.

## Installation

20.11.1 <= Node Version < 21 (It cannot be used with versions later than 20 because node-sass is depricated)
```
1. Download and install node
2. `cd` into repository
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm install -g gulp`
5. Run `npm rebuild node-sass`
6. Run `npm rebuild electron`
```

You may create a binary for your platform by calling 

`npm run dist`

## Usage

1. If you have the executable: look under the 'dist' folder
2. Alternatively use ```npm run start``` from your commmand line
