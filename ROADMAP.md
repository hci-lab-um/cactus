# Cactus - roadmap

## Planned features

1. Integrate ModaliKey
2. Integrate multi-modal interaction (i.e. custom cursor responding to click events - configurable to respond to any key or key combination which could be programmed into Hitch 2.0 or any adaptive swtich)
3. Integrate with WebGazer for cursor control without the need for an eye tracker (configurable)
4. Add Configuration screens
