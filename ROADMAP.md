# Cactus - Roadmap

## Future features

1. Generating the quadtree inside iframes and therefore have the ability interact with its elements through the sidebar.
2. Browser History
3. When a form is present on a page, it would be populated with the previous response (E.g. autocompleting a sign in form).
4. Faster typing and allowing consecutive special characters to be printed. 

## Out of Scope
### The assumption is that users already have software that allow them to perform these actions
1. Copy and paste - copying text could be by selecting the starting point and end point through 2 seperate clicks. This sequence of actions could be indentified after specifying the intent through a button somewhere
2. Drag and drop

## Notes
1.  Cactus works with any ET that is supported by Windows Eye Control or Tobii Gaze Point, as opposed to being directly integrated with specific ETs.
