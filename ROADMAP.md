# Cactus - Roadmap

## Future features

1. Browser History
2. Add support for `<datalist>` element
3. Add form data storage support (autocomplete). When a form is present on a page, it would be populated with previously used data.
4. Move away from Robotjs to support faster typing and allowing consecutive special characters to be printed.
5. Handle IFrames better. Generate Quadtrees inside iframes to provide the ability interact with its elements through the sidebar.

## Out of Scope
### The assumption is that users already have software that allow them to perform these actions
1. Copy and paste - copying text could be by selecting the starting point and end point through 2 seperate clicks. This sequence of actions could be indentified after specifying the intent through a button somewhere
2. Drag and drop

## Notes
1.  Cactus works with any ET that is supported by Windows Eye Control or Tobii Gaze Point, as opposed to being directly integrated with specific ETs.
