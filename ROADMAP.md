# Cactus - roadmap

## Planned features

1. Pick up all interactive elements (including input fields)
2. Select only x amount of interactive elements, to avoid scrolling in sidebar... but also offer it in case it is required
3. Integrate SwitfKey or ModaliKey (see note 1)
4. Integrate multi-modal interaction (i.e. custom cursor responding to click events - configurable to respond to any key or key combination which could be programmed into Hitch 2.0 or any adaptive swtich)
5. Integrate with WebGazer for cursor control without the need for an eye tracker (configurable)
6. Add Configuration screens

## Notes
1. It might be better if Cactus works with any ET that is supported by Windows Eye Control or Tobii Gaze Point, as opposed to integrating directly with specific ETs. 
2. To create Logos and icon packs (current logo is from icons8)
3. Add About section, and add reference to any attribution-specific resources

4. Create installer with splash screen.
